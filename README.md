# CodingQuiz

## Project

In this project I am creating a quiz with a timer.
If the user completes the quiz within the alotted time, the remaining time is saved to local storage and that is there is their score for the quiz.
<br>
<br>
When the user selects the incorrect answer, time is taken away.
<br>
<br>
If the users guess too many incorrect answers, and the the timer hits 0 or below, the quiz ends and the remaining time is their score.
<br>
<br>
The user can save all these scores using local storage and push them to the highscores page.
